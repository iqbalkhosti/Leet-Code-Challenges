# Leet-Code-Challenges
This repository is for all my Leet Code challenges that I completed.

The naming for each challenges label their level of hardship with the first part of the code starting with its degree of hardship, followed by Lt and then its index number. So, an easy Leet Code challenge that has index 1 would be written like this: "EasyLt01.java".
